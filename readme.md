This extension removes content from websites that contain the following keywords:

* "COVID"
* "corona" or "virus",
* "quarantine" or "lockdown"
* "pandemic"

Additional words may be added at the top of `content.js` as appropriate.

Some special cases are handled on some of the most popular English-language websites to remove content at the card/article level, instead of removing the text alone.
